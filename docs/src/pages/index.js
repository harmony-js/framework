                  <h2>Introduction</h2>
                  <p>
                    Harmony aims to be a full-featured, easy to use and fully upgradable framework
                    for building fast and reactive web applications.
                  </p>
                </header>
                <p>
                  In this short guide, we will see the principles behind the framework by creating a small app
                  from scratch.
                  The application we'll be building will be a very simple chat room with no security whatsoever.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Chatroom Example will demonstrate how the framework handles API calls, persistent data, and
                  realtime updates. We will build it in three separate steps :


                  <br />
                  <br />

                  <br />
                  <b>Step 1: Creating the server</b>
                  <br />
                      In this step we will show how Harmony allows us to rapidly setup a production-ready
                      web server, helps us define models for our persistent data, and exposes a ready to use API over a
                      GraphQL endpoint.

                  <br />
                  <br />

                  <b>Step 2: Adding the frontend</b>
                  <br />
                      Once our backend is ready, we will develop a Single-Page Frontend Application using Webpack and
                      React, and connect it to our backend using the Frontend tools provided by Harmony.

                  <br />
                  <br />

                  <b>Step 3: Supercharging the frontend using GatsbyJS</b>
                  <br />
                      Finally, we will take advantage of Harmony's modular backend to convert our Frontend to a
                      Gatsby static site, merging the best of the static and dynamic worlds.

              <h2>Step 1: Creating a server</h2>
              <p>
                The first step of creating a custom web application is to deploy the underlying server app.
                Without further ado, here is how to do it using Harmony.
              </p>
            </header>

            <div style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>
              <h2>1.1 - Initialize the app</h2>

              <p>
                First, we will create the NPM package that will be holding our server code.
                Let's call it <b>chatroom-server</b>.
                <br />
                Once created, we will simply add the <b>server</b> package of Harmony.
              </p>
              <pre>
                <code>
                  $ mkdir chatroom-server
                  <br />
                  $ cd chatroom-server
                  <br />
                  $ npm init
                  <br />
                  $ npm install --save @harmonyjs/server
                </code>
              </pre>

              <p>
                We will just make one small addition to the above setup allowing us to use the import/export syntax in
                our server code: installing the <b>esm</b> package.
              </p>

              <pre>
                <code>
                $ npm install --save-dev esm
                </code>
              </pre>

              <p>
                Now, instead of launching our server with
                the <code style={{ whiteSpace: 'nowrap' }}>node index.js</code> command, we will simply be able to
                add <code style={{ whiteSpace: 'nowrap' }}>-r esm</code> like so:
                <code style={{ whiteSpace: 'nowrap' }}>node -r esm index.js</code>, and be able to use the
                import/export syntax in our code.
              </p>

              <h2>1.2 - Create an empty server</h2>
              <p>
                Next, let's create the entry point of our app: <b>index.js</b>!
                Here is what it looks like for a minimal setup of Harmony Server:
              </p>

              <Highlight className="javascript">
                {
                  `import Server from '@harmonyjs/server'

const server = new Server()

server.init({
  // This is the configuration object of Harmony Server

  // Setup the main endpoint on which our application will be served
  endpoint: {
    host: 'localhost',
    port: 8888,
  },


  // Setup logging to go to the console.
  // If this is not provided, all logging will go into a .log file at the root
  log: {
    console: true,
  },
})`
                }
              </Highlight>

              <p>
                This simple code creates a new Harmony Server instance, and initializes it with the given parameters.
                For now, we simply set the endpoint on which our application needs to be served, and we enable logging
                to be able to track what happens more easily.
              </p>
              <p>
                Running our code using <code>node -r esm index.js</code>, we get the following output, showing that
                Harmony has correctly initialized our server:
              </p>

              <pre>

                </code>
              </pre>


              <p>
                As we can see, the server has correctly booted and is using our given parameters. By default, it does
                nothing else, except setup a basic Authentication system which we will be able to
                take advantage of later.
              </p>


              <h2>1.3 - Adding data persistence</h2>

              <p>
                An application is no use if it cannot store and provide data. In order to do that, Harmony
                provides a simple way of adding a persistence layer: the <b>persistence</b> module!
              </p>
              <p>
                This module allows us to feed Harmony with data models, and expose them through a
                configurable GraphQL endpoint. We can then configure it further to connect to our preferred database.
                <br />
                Let's add it to our new app:
              </p>
              <pre>
                <code>
                  $ npm install --save @harmonyjs/persistence
                </code>
              </pre>
              <p>
                Now that we have the package available, all we have to do is configure our Persistence instance.
                Let's add it to our <b>index.js</b> file:
              </p>

              <Highlight className="javascript">
                {
                  `import Server from '@harmonyjs/server'
import Persistence from '@harmonyjs/persistence'

const persistence = new Persistence()

persistence.init({
  // Setup our data models (empty for now)
  models: [],

  // Setup logging to go to the console.
  // If this is not provided, all logging will go into a .log file at the root
  log: {
    console: true,
  },
})

// ...
`
                }
              </Highlight>

              <p>
                Relaunching our server, we see that Persistence is initialized. However, it does not do anything on its
                own: we need to feed it our data models, and configure accessors.
              </p>

              </pre>
              <p>
                Let's start by creating our models! Since we will be making a chatroom, we need at least the
                following models:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <b>User:</b> a model handling the user information (display name, customization...)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Room:</b> a model defining a room, in which messages will be exchanged
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Message:</b> a model for saving and loading messages
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </p>

              <p>
                We will start by creating a <b>models</b> folder, in which we will create three subfolders,
                one for each model, and an <b>index.js</b> file for exporting them as an array of models.
              </p>

              <pre>
                <code>
                  $ mkdir models
                  <br />
                  $ mkdir models/user
                  <br />
                  $ mkdir models/room
                  <br />
                  $ mkdir models/message
                  <br />
                  $ touch models/index.js
                </code>
              </pre>

              <p>
                The content of <b>models/index.js</b> should look like this:
              </p>

              <Highlight className="javascript">
                {`import user from './user'
import room from './room'
import message from './message'

export default [
  user,
  room,
  message,
]`}
              </Highlight>

              <p>
                Now, for each model, we will create an <b>index.js</b> file which will hold the configuration of our
                model.
                For instance, the <b>user/index.js</b> file should look like this:
              </p>

              <Highlight className="javascript">
                {
                  `import schema from './schema'

export default {
  name: 'user',
  schema,
}
`
                }
              </Highlight>

              <p>
                Create the same file for all models, simply changing the name property accordingly. For better results,
                the name property should be lowercase and singular.
              </p>
              <p>
                Notice how we imported a <b>schema.js</b> file, which does not exist yet. This file will be where we
                define how our data should look like.
                Let's go ahead and create the user's schema.
                A user should have a username used for login, a display name that will be configurable later and used
                in chat sessions, and a color that will be used for their speech bubbles. The username should be unique.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is what such a schema would look like.
              </p>

              <Highlight className="javascript">
                {
                  `import { Types } from '@harmonyjs/persistence'

export default {
  username: Types.String.unique,
  displayName: Types.String,
  color: Types.String,
}`
                }
              </Highlight>

              <p>
                Nice!
                Now that we defined how our users would look like, let's do the same for the rooms.
                A room is defined entirely by the users in it. It contains a single field, <b>usernames</b>.
              </p>

              <Highlight className="javascript">
                {
                  `import { Types } from '@harmonyjs/persistence'

export default {
  usernames: [Types.String],
}`
                }
              </Highlight>

              <p>
                Here again, this is a straightforward representation.
                We declare an array of objects which are of type <b>String</b>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Our last model is the <b>message</b> model. A message should have an author, some content, a date, and
                a room in which it was posted. It will look like this:
              </p>

              <Highlight className="javascript">
                {
                  `import { Types } from '@harmonyjs/persistence'
import user from '../user'

export default {
  author: Types.Reference.of(user),
  room: Types.ID,
  content: Types.String,
  timestamp: Types.Date,
}`
                }
              </Highlight>

              <p>
                <b>Note:</b> notice how both <b>author</b> and <b>room</b> are linked to another model,
                but <b>room</b> is only an ID while <b>author</b> is a Reference.
                That is because we might need to display information about a message's author, but we only care
                about the ID of the room, not its information, to retrieve a message. Using a Reference field allows
                Harmony to retrieve the complete document upon request.
              </p>

              <p>
                Now that we have all our model ready, we just need to inject them in <b>index.js</b>:
              </p>

              <Highlight className="javascript">
                {
                  `import Server from '@harmonyjs/server'
import Persistence from '@harmonyjs/persistence'
import models from './models'

// ...

persistence.init({
  // Setup our data by injecting the imported models
  models,

  // ...
})

// ...`
                }
              </Highlight>

              <p>
                We can now reboot our server, and this time the persistence module should tell us that our models

              <p>
                All that we are missing now is an accessor. Accessors are Harmony plugins allowing to instruct
                Persistence on how to store and retrieve data.
              </p>
              <p>
                By default, Persistence converts our models into a GraphQL schema with no resolvers. Accessors are
                simply resolver definition to plug on top of our GraphQL schema.
              </p>
              <p>
                For this example, we are going to use a MongoDB database. In order to connect Harmony to our MongoDB
                endpoint, we simply need to inject the <b>@harmonyjs/accessor-mongoose</b> Accessor.
              </p>

                At this point we are almost done creating our server. All we need to add now is a way to access our
                data.
              </p>

              <p>
                As stated earlier, Persistence creates a GraphQL schema, on which we just plugged Mongo resolvers.
              </p>

              <p>
                However, Persistence itself cannot expose this schema to the world. This is the responsibility of our
                Server instance. Harmony Servers expose data to the world through Controllers. Controllers, just like
                Accessors, are Harmony plugins. Those plugins use the underlying HapiJS server to expose custom routes.
              </p>

              <p>
                In our case, we will not import ourselves any Controllers, but instead use two controllers provided and
                configured by our Persistence instance : a <b>ControllerGraphQL</b> exposing the GraphQL schema, and
                a <b>ControllerEvents</b> forwarding events generated by Persistence to a Socket.IO connection.
              </p>

              <p>
                To register Controllers on our Server instance, we simply need to add a <b>controllers</b> array to the
                configuration object.
              </p>

                If you now navigate to <a href="http://localhost:8888/graphql">http://localhost:8888/graphql</a>,
                you should be able to see that our models have been imported into a full-blown GraphQL API:

                <b>Note: </b>
                If we instanciated our GraphQL controller without adding any accessor, the schema would still be fully
                computed. In this case, Harmony would automatically <i>mock</i> all of the resolvers, allowing you
                to test your schema before configuring your actual database.
              </p>

              <h2>1.4 - Adding custom functionality</h2>

              <p>
                We're almost to the point where we can start working on our client side.
                All we have left is writing a few custom fields and queries to make our models easier to use and
                better fit our workcase.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fortunately, the persistence module has just what we need for this:
                the <b>fields</b> parameter when defining models.
              </p>

              <p>
                The things we will be adding are the following:
              </p>
              <p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <b>Add a login query:</b> we should have a login query that allows us to log in with a given
                    username. Since we are building a <i>unsecure</i> chatroom, the login query will also create the
                    user if it does not exist yet.
                  </li>

                  <br />

                  <li>
                    <b>Always return a display name:</b> we will modify the way the <b>displayName</b> property is
                    fetched so that it returns the <b>username</b> if no <b>displayName</b> has been set yet. This way
                    we won't have to care about that on the client side.
                  </li>

                  <br />

                  <li>
                    <b>Identify the connected user:</b> calling a query updating or getting the user should not require
                    an ID filter, since we know which user is connected. The same applies when posting a new message.
                  </li>

                  <br />

                  <li>
                    <b>Automatically add timestamps:</b> our messages have timestamps. We will make it so that the
                    timestamp is automatically added by the server when we post a new message.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </p>

              <p>
                But first, let's talk a bit about the <b>fields</b> parameter. This parameter is our entry point for
                adding custom fields to our GraphQL schema. Using it, we can choose to extend our models by adding new,
                virtual fields that we will be able to read just like any other field. We can also extend the root Query
                and Mutation objects of our GraphQL schema, either by adding custom queries and mutations, or by
                overriding the ones generated by Harmony.
              </p>

              <p>
                The <b>fields</b> parameter has the
                following shape:
              </p>

              <Highlight className="javascript">
                {`{
  fields: { // Definition of new fields to add to our model
    customField: // Definition of the 'customField' field
  },

  queries: { // Definition of new queries to add to the GraphQL schema
    customQuery: // Definition of the 'customQuery' query
  },

  mutations: { // Definition of new mutations to add to the GraphQL schema
    customMutation: // Definition of the 'customMutation' mutation
  },
}`}
              </Highlight>

              <p>
                Let's see those fields in action by implementing the logic described above.
              </p>

              <h3>Adding a login query</h3>

              <p>
                We will add the login query in the <b>users</b> model fields modifier. For queries and mutations, it
                does not matter which model adds them, but it is a better practice to keep concerns together.
              </p>
              <p>
                Let's add a <b>fields.js</b> file in the <b>models/users</b> directory.
                We will then import it in <b>models/users/index.js</b> and add it to the configuration:
              </p>

              <Highlight className="javascript">
                {`import schema from './schema'
import fields from './fields'

export default {
  name: 'users',
  schema,
  fields,
}
`}
              </Highlight>

              <p>
                As said earlier, the field file should export an object containing
                (optional) <b>fields</b>, <b>queries</b> and <b>mutations</b> keys. For now, we'll create the
                following <b>query</b>:
              </p>

              <Highlight className="javascript">
                {`import { Types } from '@harmonyjs/persistence'

export default {
  queries: {
    login: {
      type: Types.String,
      args: {
        username: Types.String,
      },
      resolve: async ({ args, resolvers: { User }, context: { authentication } }) => {
        let user = await User.get({ filter: { username: args.username } })

        if (!user) {
          const created = await User.create({ record: { username: args.username } })

          user = created.record
        }

        return authentication.create(
          { _id: user._id },
        )
      },
    },
  },
}
`}
              </Highlight>

              <p>
                To learn more about the <b>queries</b>, <b>mutations</b> and <b>fields</b> format,
                refer to the <Link to="api">API reference</Link>.
              </p>

              <p>
                The query here is straightforward: we use the <b>User resolver</b> to get access to
                our <b>user</b> model. We first try to get our user, then we create it if it does not exist yet.
                We then use the <b>authentication</b> object provided in the resolver context by Harmony to create
                a new authentication token, which we send back to the client as a response.
              </p>

              <h3>Always returning a display name</h3>

              <p>
                For this next rule, we will modify the way the <b>displayName</b> field is retrieved. This is done
                by adding a <b>fields</b> key to our configuration object. By convention, we add it before
                the <b>queries</b> key.
              </p>

              <Highlight className="javascript">
                {`export default {
  fields: {
    displayName: {
      type: Types.String,
      resolve: async ({ source }) => source.displayName || source.username,
    },
  },

  queries: {
    // ...
  }
}`}
              </Highlight>

              <p>
                The format here is similar to the one we used to create a query. We define a <b>displayName</b> field,
                which returns a String. The <b>resolve</b> function then returns the display name, and if it does
                not exist, it returns the username.
              </p>

              <p>
                Notice how we called our field <b>displayName</b> even though this field already existed on our model.
                Doing so, we actually overrode the way GraphQL resolves the field. It is not possible anymore to get an
                empty display name.
                We could have decided to name our field differently, for instance <b>resolvedName</b>. Doing so,
                the <b>displayName</b> field would have been left untouched, and a read-only <b>resolvedName</b> field
                would have been added to our model.
              </p>

              <h3>Identifying the connected user</h3>

              <p>
                When creating our login query, we created a token containing the user's ID. Now, we will take advantage
                of this token and automatically retrieve the ID whenever the <b>update user mutation</b> is called.
              </p>

              <p>
                In order to do this, we'll add a <b>mutations</b> key to our configuration object. By convention, we add
                it right after the <b>queries</b> key.
              </p>

              <Highlight className="javascript">
                {`export default {
  // ...

  mutations: {
    userUpdate: {
      extends: 'update',
      resolve: async ({ args, resolvers: { User }, context: { authentication } }) => {
        // Retrieve the ID from the authentication object
        const userId = authentication.get()._id

        // Call the User update method with updated arguments
        return User.update({
          record: {
            _id: userId,
            ...args.record,
          },
        })
      },
    },
  },
}
`}
              </Highlight>

              <p>
                In this mutation query, we simply intercept the <b>userUpdate</b> query and inject the connected user's
                ID into the <b>User.update</b> call.
              </p>

              <p>
                We also used the <b>extends</b> property instead of the <b>type</b> one: this way we instruct Harmony
                to reuse exactly the same type and argument lists as for an <b>update</b> internal resolver.
                <br />
                Available extends types are <b>get</b>, <b>list</b>, <b>count</b>, <b>create</b>, <b>createMany</b>
                {', '}
                <b>update</b>, <b>updateMany</b>, <b>delete</b> and <b>deleteMany</b>
              </p>

              <p>
                We need to do the same thing with the <b>user</b> query, in order to retrieve the connected user when
                no id is passed.
              </p>



              <Highlight className="javascript">
                {`export default {
  // ...

  queries: {
    // ...
    user: {
      extends: 'get',
      resolve: async ({ args, resolvers: { User }, context: { authentication } }) => {
        // Retrieve the ID from the authentication object
        const userId = authentication.get()._id

        // Call the User get method with updated arguments
        return User.get({
          record: {
            _id: userId,
            ...args.record,
          },
        })
      },
    },
  },
}
`}
              </Highlight>

              <h3>Automatically adding timestamps</h3>

              <p>
                Our <b>messages</b> model has a timestamp field. In order to automate the creation of
                those timestamps, we need to create a <b>fields.js</b> file for the <b>messages</b> model,
                and inject it just like we did for the <b>users</b> model.
                Once this is done, we will be modifying mutations to include our timestamps.
              </p>

              <p>
                For <b>messages</b>, we need to keep the creation timestamp and as such, we will modify
                the <b>createMessage</b> mutation. We also need to add the connected user as the author.
              </p>

              <Highlight className="javascript">
                {`export default {
  mutations: {
    messageCreate: {
      extends: 'create',
      resolve: async ({ args, resolvers: { Message }, context: { authentication } }) => {
        // Get the current user
        const userId = authentication.get()._id

        // Get the current timestamp
        const timestamp = new Date().toISOString()

        // Call the Message create method with updated arguments
        return Message.create({
          record: {
            ...args.record,
            timestamp,
            author: userId,

              <p>
                In order to have a fully working backend, we simply need to update our <b>room</b> model so that we

                the <b>get room</b> query as follow, after creating and injecting a <b>fields.js</b> file for
                the <b>room</b> model.

                And that's it! We've prepared all the groundwork for our chatroom application. From there, we will be
                able to focus on the client side, and we can leave the backend alone. You can already fiddle with the
                GraphQL Playground at <a href="http://localhost:8888/graphql">http://localhost:8888/graphql</a> to see
                how our modified fields and queries act.

              <h2>Step 2: Adding a frontend</h2>
              <p>
                Now that we have our working server, we will add a frontend application connecting to it. For this
                example, we will create an SPA using <b>create-react-app</b>.
              </p>
            </header>

            <div style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>
              <h2>2.1 - Initialize the app</h2>

              <p>
                Let's go ahead and create our SPA. We will call it <b>chatroom-spa</b>. To create it, run the following
                commands:
              </p>

              <pre>
                <code>
                  $ npx create-react-app chatroom-spa
                  <br />
                  $ cd chatroom-spa
                </code>
              </pre>

              <p>
                We can now launch our app using the <code>npm start</code> command.
              </p>

              <p>
                This will launch our SPA on port 3000 by default. In order to simplify our development experience and
                not get tangled in many different hosts, we will tell our server to also serve our SPA on a given path.
                Since <b>create-react-app</b> applications are designed to work on path <b>/</b>, we will tell our
                server to serve it on this path.
              </p>

              <p>
                To do this, we need to slightly modify our server initialization to tell it to serve an SPA. This is
                done by passing it a configured <b>controller</b>. As a reminder, Controllers are small piece of server
                code that handle route accesses. We already used a Controller earlier to expose our GraphQL endpoint.
              </p>

              <p>
                We will now be adding the SPA controller.
              </p>

              <Highlight className="javascript">
                import ControllerSPA from '@harmonyjs/controller-spa'
              </Highlight>

              <p>
                We then add it to our <b>controllers</b> key in our server configuration object, and we instantiate our
                SPA Controller with the following parameters:
              </p>

              <Highlight className="javascript">
                {`server.init({
  // ...

  controllers: [
    // ...
    
    new ControllerSPA({
      // Serve our SPA on '/'
      path: '/',
      // Use development mode by default
      forceStatic: false,

      // Our static files are located in the 'public' folder of the 'chatroom-spa' package
      statics: {
        dir: path.resolve(__dirname, '../chatroom-spa/public/'),
        path: '/',
      },

      // In development, we need to proxy our request to the Hot-Module-Replacement server
      // launched by create-react-app, on port 3000
      hmr: {
        endpoint: 'localhost',
        port: 3000,
      },
    }),
  ],
})`}
              </Highlight>

              <p>
                And that's it! Relaunch your server, navigate
                to <a href="http://localhost:8888">http://localhost:8888</a> and you should see your new React
                application ready!
              </p>

              <h3>2.2 - Install dependencies</h3>

              <p>
                Now is the time to add the dependencies our application will be needing. Since we are building a really
                simple app, we will only be needing two dependencies: <b>@reach/router</b> for handling our client-side
                routes, and <b>@harmonyjs/query</b> for handling queries from the client to our Harmony
                server. Go ahead and install them:
              </p>

              <pre>
                <code>
                  npm install --save @reach/router @harmonyjs/query
                </code>
              </pre>

              <h3>2.3 - Defining the needed routes</h3>

              <p>
                It's time to start building our actual application! To get started, we will define the following routes:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>/</b>: will show a login page or redirect to <b>/chat</b> if already logged in.
                </li>

                <br />

                <li>
                  <b>/chat</b>: will show a chat box connected to the global room (all users)
                </li>

                <br />

                <li>
                  <b>/chat/{'{users*}'}</b>: will show a chat box connected to a room with the connected user and the
                  user(s) specified as path variables.
                </li>

                <br />

                <li>
                  <b>/chat/profile</b>: allow the connected user to update it's profile information: color and display
                  name.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Modify your <b>App.js</b> to look like this:
              </p>

              <p>
                The login page contains a simple login form asking for a username. Upon submit, we use the Harmony
                Query module to launch our <b>login</b> query. This query is the one we created earlier, which takes
                a username and returns a token. We then simply store the token into our local storage, and navigate
                to <b>/chat</b>
              </p>

              <p>
                Right before storing the token in the local storage, we pass it into
                the <b>Query.configure</b> function.
                This tells the Query module how to authenticate when querying our server.
              </p>

              <p>
                Since once logged in, we will not go through this step every time, we need to add a bit of logic at the
                loading of the page. Let's add a <b>constructor</b> lifecycle hook to our main component:
              </p>

              <Highlight className="javascript">
                {`import React from 'react';
import { Router, navigate } from '@reach/router'

// ...

class App extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super()

    // Check if the token is available in local storage
    const token = window.localStorage.getItem('token')

    Query.configure({
      token
    })

    if(token) {
      if(!window.location.pathname.startsWith('/chat')) {
        navigate('/chat')
      }
    } else {
      navigate('/')
    }
  }

  // ...
}

export default App
`}
              </Highlight>

              <p>
                Sweet! We now have a working login logic! We can now proceed to creating the chatbox, which will
                connect to the rooms and display messages.
              </p>

              <h3>2.5 - Creating the Chatbox component</h3>

              <p>
                Go ahead and create a <b>components</b> folder next to your <b>pages</b> folder.
                Then, add a <b>chatbox.jsx</b> component in it.
              </p>

              <p>
                Our chatbox should look like this:
              </p>

                As we can see, the Chatbox component displays a list of messages (not fetched yet), and the list of
                users in the room. If no user are specified, it defaults to a room with everyone. We can already use
                this component by adding it to our GlobalRoom and UserRoom pages:

              <p>
                Alright! Now is the time to connect the state on our chatbox component. We will be using
                the <b>query</b> module that we installed and configure to retrieve the chatroom and the messages
                associated to it. We will add a <b>retrieveRoomAndMessages</b> function to our component, which we will
                call in the <b>componentDidMount</b> lifecycle hook.
              </p>

              <p>
                But first, let's talk about the <b>query</b> module's <b>Controller</b> constructor. This constructor
                allows us to create structures to easily access our models. Let's import it and create a controller for
                our <b>rooms</b> and <b>messages</b>.
              </p>

              <Highlight className="javascript">
                {`import React from 'react'
import { Controller } from '@harmonyjs/query'

const RoomController = new Controller('room')
const MessageController = new Controller('message')

export default class Chatbox extends React.Component {
  // ...
}`}
              </Highlight>

              <p>
                Using our new controllers, we can write our <b>retrieveRoomAndMessages</b> function.
              </p>

              <Highlight className="javascript">
                {`  componentDidMount() {
    this.retrieveRoomAndMessages()
  }

  retrieveRoomAndMessages = async () => {
    const { users } = this.props

    let room = null
    if(users) {
      room = await RoomController.query
        .get()
        .where({
          usernames: this.props.users,
        })
        .select({
          _id: true,
        })
    }

    this.setState({ room })

    MessageController.query
      .list()
      .where({
        room: room ? room._id : null,
      })
      .select({
        author: {
          displayName: true,
          color: true,
        },
        content: true,
        timestamp: true,
      })
      .subscribe((messages) => {
        this.setState({ messages })
      })
  }`}
              </Highlight>

              <p>
                As we can see, each controller exposes a <b>query</b> object in which the three query functions (get,
                list and count) are made available. We define our filter arguments using <b>where()</b>, and we select
                the fields we need using <b>select()</b>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Each query made through a controller can then be used as a Promise, like we do with the room query,
                or be subscribed to so that the callback is called each time the underlying data changes, as we do with
                the messages.
              </p>

              <p>
                With those simple queries, we've actually built a real-time chatbox, since the messages state will be
                updated at every new message in the room!
              </p>

              <p>
                All that is left to add is a way to post a message. This can be done through another object exposed by
                the controller: <b>mutate</b>. We will add it to the <b>sendMessage</b> function.
              </p>

              <Highlight className="javascript">
                {`  sendMessage = async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault()
    
    const content = {
      content: this.state.message,
    }

    if(this.state.room && this.state.room._id) {
      content.room = this.state.room._id
    }

    await MessageController.mutate
      .create()
      .withContent(content)

    this.setState({
      message: ''
    })
  }`}
              </Highlight>

              <p>
                The <b>mutate</b> object allows us to call the various mutations: create, createMany, update and delete.
              </p>
