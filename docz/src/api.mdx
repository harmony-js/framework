The `@harmonyjs/server` package exposes the API needed to bootstrap an Harmony application. It's the cornerstone of the
server part. Find its full API [here](/api/server).


<h2>
 <samp>@harmonyjs/persistence</samp>
</h2>

`@harmonyjs/persistence` provides a way to describe our data, configure database access and optionally compile a
GraphQL schema. Its API can be found [here](/api/persistence).


<h2>
 <samp>@harmonyjs/query</samp>
</h2>

Finally, the `@harmonyjs/query` packages is used on the client side to create our server calls. Read the API [here](/api/query).
