# HarmonyJS

Welcome to HarmonyJS documentation website. HarmonyJS is a simple yet complete NodeJS framework
for building next-generation websites and applications.

## Philosophy

HarmonyJS is a data-first, reactive framework primarily aimed at large and scalable applications.
It relies on established as well as state-of-the-art technologies such as changestreams, websockets and GraphQL
to provide amazing performances and an awesome developer experience.

All parts of HarmonyJS are built with stateless-ness in mind, inspired by GraphQL resolvers which are a big part of
the core framework. Because of this stateless philosophy, Harmony applications are scalable horizontally out-of-the-box.

## Getting started

HarmonyJS is composed of three core packages: `@harmonyjs/server`, `@harmonyjs/persistence` and `@harmonyjs/query`.

- On the server-side, `@harmonyjs/server` provides the core functionality of of webserver. `@harmonyjs/persistence` helps
us define and access our data.
- On the client-side, `@harmonyjs/query` allows us to write our API calls and subscribe to our data changes.

HarmonyJS packages are standard NPM packages and requires no specific CLI whatsoever. Just add them to your project.

**Server-side installation:**

```bash
npm i @harmonyjs/server @harmonyjs/persistence
```

**Client-side installation:**

```bash
npm i @harmonyjs/query
```
