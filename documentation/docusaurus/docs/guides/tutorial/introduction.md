title: Building a HarmonyJS application
sidebar_label: Tutorial - Introduction
---

In this guide, we will be building a web application from the ground up using all the tools
HarmonyJS has to give us.

As for most web development project, we will start with the iconic "To-do list Application",
but taking full advantage of Harmony, this to-do list sample will be supercharged with a few
interesting features:

* A complete authentication system including sign-up and log-in
* Creation of multiple lists, each with its own set of tasks
* Ability to add comments on each task
* Ability to share lists with others

## Server-side technologies

The server-side application for our todo-list sample will be fully Harmony, and will be using
[MongoDb](https://mongodb.org/) as a database.

## Client-side technologies

For the client-side, we will be relying on [React](http://reactjs.org/) and [Infima](https://facebookincubator.github.io/infima/docs/getting-started/introduction),
as well as the `@harmonyjs/query` client package.

React is not needed to take advantage of Harmony, but it pairs nicely with the reactive nature
of the framework (no pun intended).

## Final output

Here is a quick preview of what the final output will look like:
